{cslinux1:~} man ls

              name.

       --scontext
              Display only security context and file name.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE  is  an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024)
       or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With  --color=auto,  ls  emits
       color codes only when standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the set‐
       tings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

{cslinux1:~} man cp | less

       That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE
       file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is  specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.
       If this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may  be  selected
       via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the
       same name for an existing, regular file.
